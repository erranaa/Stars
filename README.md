# Stars
## DESIGN OVERVIEW:
- I used abstract factory to create my objects and builders to decide the type of the object needed to be created.
- I created Star objects from the Universe class, created planet objects in the Star class. I have a main to start the compilation from Universe class.
- I could not use the search algorithm that I have thought but I think Binary search with keeping coordinates in a list would be the easiest and appropriate approach in terms of not trying to compare all the Star coordinates from the beginning(in terms of a large data problem).
- I could not complete searching lives part of the project, I was able to create objects and sub-objects but without getter and setters it was really hard for me to approach the attributes of different classes, I took a lot of errors in spite of the fact that I was feeling comfortable about thinking through.
- I will be uploading the code as the not working part commented out.
